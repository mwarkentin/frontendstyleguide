# Frontend Style Guide

## General Code

* Add helpful comments, especially to describe what functions do or when you've done something potentially confusing or exceedingly clever.

* `TODO`s seem helpful but often are not -- they tend to lose their context and go stale and everyone thinks everyone else will eventually take care of it. If you add one, either resolve it right away (eg. use it as a temporary note to yourself) or take it out and make a ticket.

* Try to avoid leaving trailing whitespace. Some of us auto-remove this, and that can leave changesets quite noisy.

* Eliminate unneeded code. Don't comment it out or leave it otherwise hanging around "just in case we might want it later". That's what we have version control for. Or save it for yourself somewhere else. [[1](http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1334908)]
